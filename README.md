## Overview

The NBA MVP Predictor Tool is a machine learning project that uses player statistics and team performance data to predict the MVP for the current NBA season. The tool leverages various data sources to gather historical player stats and uses feature engineering and machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

## Features

- **Historical Data Collection**: The tool gathers and cleans historical NBA player statistics from reputable sources.
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced metrics and team performance data are used to engineer features that enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements the Random Forest algorithm for predicting the MVP.
- **Prediction**: Provides predictions for the MVP based on current year data.
- **Accuracy**: Achieves a high level of accuracy by using different classification models.

## Data Sources

The tool collects historical player statistics from reputable sources like [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) and other online databases.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```shell
